# 2026-01-29 - Memory Notes

## WordPress Connection Attempt
- Tried XML-RPC API authentication with credentials (clawd + app password)
- Security plugin or 2FA blocking API access despite web login working
- Created `/home/ubuntu/bestgrowthapps/article-1-complete.html` - ready to paste into WordPress

## Report Scripts Created
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/daily-report.sh` - Daily morning report generator
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/weekly-report.sh` - Weekly summary report
- Cron tool schema conflicts prevented automated scheduling
- Solution: Scripts can be run via Hostinger's built-in cron (free)

## Heartbeat Configuration
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with morning report checklist
- Morning report covers: QC Restaurants status, BestGrowthApps stats, tasks

## Files Created
- `/home/ubuntu/bestgrowthapps/article-1-complete.html` - 15 Best Shopify Pre Order Apps (ready-to-paste HTML)
- `/home/ubuntu/bestgrowthapps/content-calendar.md` - Content calendar + templates
- Daily/weekly report scripts

## Issues to Remember
- WordPress API authentication requires Application Password or plugin (JWT/WP REST API)
- Hostinger cron can run the report scripts instead of Clawdbot cron
